                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>This project explores simulated Starbucks transaction data to predict how customers respond to
                    different offer types. The goal is to build a model that can identify the most effective offers for
                    each customer, improving the return on marketing spend and enhancing customer experience. </p>


                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>The main objective is to use machine learning to predict whether a customer will respond positively
                    to an offer. This involves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Classifying offers as successful or unsuccessful based on customer behavior.</li>
                    <li>Building a predictive model to identify the best offer for each customer.</li>
                    <li>Comparing the performance of different machine learning algorithms, including a neural network.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <h3>1. Data Gathering</h3>
                <p>The project uses three simulated datasets provided by Udacity:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>portfolio.json:</b> Contains information about the different offers, such as reward,
                        difficulty, duration, and offer type.</li>
                    <li><b>profile.json:</b> Contains demographic data for each customer, including gender, age,
                        income, and membership date.</li>
                    <li><b>transcript.json:</b> Contains records of transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and
                        offers completed.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Data Exploration and Preparation</h3>
                <p>The datasets were explored to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and clean any
                    inconsistencies. This involved:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Analyzing the distribution of offer characteristics.</li>
                    <li>Identifying and handling missing values in customer demographics.</li>
                    <li>Visualizing the frequency of different events over time.</li>
                    <li>Analyzing the relationship between offer characteristics and customer response.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="image-center">
                    <img src="placeholder_image1.png" alt="Placeholder for data exploration image 1"> 
                </div>
                <div class="image-center">
                    <img src="placeholder_image2.png" alt="Placeholder for data exploration image 2">
                </div>

                <h3>3. Feature Engineering</h3>
                <p>New features were engineered to improve the model's predictive power. These included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Total spending by each customer prior to receiving an offer.</li>
                    <li>Total number of transactions made by each customer.</li>
                    <li>Number of previous offers received, viewed, and completed by each customer.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Model Building</h3>
                <p>Two types of models were built and evaluated:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Benchmark Model:</b> A Random Forest Classifier from the sklearn library was chosen as the
                        benchmark model. GridSearchCV was used to optimize the model's hyperparameters for maximum
                        recall.</li>
                    <li><b>Neural Network Model:</b> A linear neural network was built using PyTorch. The network
                        architecture, loss function, and optimizer were tuned to achieve optimal performance.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="image-center">
                    <img src="placeholder_image3.png" alt="Placeholder for model building image">
                </div>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>Both models were evaluated on a held-out test set (15% of the data). The neural network model slightly
                    outperformed the benchmark model in terms of recall, accuracy, and F1-score.</p>
                <div class="image-center">
                    <img src="placeholder_image4.png" alt="Placeholder for results image"> 
                </div>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>This project demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting customer response to
                    marketing offers. The neural network model showed promising results, suggesting that deep learning
                    techniques can be valuable in this domain.</p>

                <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
                <p>Potential areas for improvement include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exploring more complex neural network architectures.</li>
                    <li>Incorporating additional features, such as time lag between offer receipt and view.</li>
                    <li>Introducing a new class for "very unsuccessful" offers where customers complete an offer without
                        viewing it.</li>
                </ul>
